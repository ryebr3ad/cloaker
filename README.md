# Cloaker
Web extension used to hide selected elements on a webpage.

This is currently only working on FireFox, and hasn't been tested for Mobile versions.  The extension is hosted here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cloaker/

There are no features being added beyond what I think up as I use the extension locally.  My algorithm for uniquely detecting elements still has a decent margin of error and the hover code through the claoaker overlay shield occasionally collides with other elements so I would like to refine that.
